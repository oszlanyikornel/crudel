<Features />

To fully set up a react project with data fetching and data manipulation can cost you a lot of time. You have to write your own `fetching` functions, manage your `state` and build custom `hooks`.

Crudel wants to take the weight of your shoulder with a simple to use hook for both fetching and manipulating data. It extends the popular _[SWR library](https://swr.vercel.app/)_ with custom data `manipulation functions` which are easy to use and fully customizable.
